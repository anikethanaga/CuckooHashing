# CuckooHashing
1.This project uses cuckoo hashing algorithm to manage large datasets(words,stocks,etc)
2. For dictionary application, we first build the hash table by reading from the file words.dict and building and
then take input from user to analyse if it is a valid word or not. If it isnt, valid replcements are found
3. Replacements are created by either adding , deleting or replacing exactly 1 letter in the word
